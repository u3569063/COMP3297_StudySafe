## About
HKU’s COVID Task Force has requested a system that would record HKU members’ entries and exits of monitored venues such as classrooms and lecture halls, trace venues visited by infected members and obtain list of close contacts. Such a system would reduce administration workload, and it would allow the Task Force to receive list of venues visited by infected members and close contacts quicker. Knowing where the infected members have visited as soon as possible would allow HKU to perform disinfection swiftly and restricting access to campus of close contacts early would further reduce possibility of infections in campus. A future extension to the system enabling HKU members to view venue availability and status would allow lectures and events hosts to receive notifications for facility disinfection earlier and change event venue in advance such that lectures and events could be held smoothly.
